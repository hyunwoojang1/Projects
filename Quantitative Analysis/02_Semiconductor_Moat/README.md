## 💡 Key Insights

* **Growth Acceleration (The Momentum Shift)**: 
    * In **2023 Q3-Q4**, NVDA's *Revenue Growth (YoY)* acceleration turned positive (visualized as **blue bars**), signaling a fundamental shift before the parabolic stock price breakout.
* **Operating Leverage (Marketing Efficiency)**: 
    * NVDA's **Marketing Efficiency** surpassed its historical peaks, demonstrating immense operating leverage as AI-driven demand scaled without a proportional increase in operational costs.
* **The "Moat" - Margin Advantage**: 
    * Unlike Intel, which suffered from eroding profitability, NVIDIA maintained a superior **Gross Margin** (nearly **80%**) even during its most aggressive growth phase, confirming its dominant pricing power and "moat" in the GPU market.
