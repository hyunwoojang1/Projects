# Hyunwoo Jang 👋
Data Science Major | Quantitative Finance & Manufacturing Analytics

Data Science major with hands-on experience in  
WRDS-based financial data analysis and quantitative modeling.  
Currently expanding into production, quality, and manufacturing analytics
for engineering-focused roles.

## About Me
I am a Data Science major with a strong interest in applying data-driven methods to both financial and industrial problems. My academic and project experience has primarily focused on quantitative finance, where I have worked extensively with WRDS datasets such as CRSP and Compustat to analyze stock returns, build predictive models, and evaluate portfolio performance using statistical and machine learning techniques. Through these projects, I developed a solid foundation in data engineering, feature construction, and model evaluation. Building on this background, I am now expanding my focus toward production, quality, and manufacturing analytics, with the goal of applying data science to real-world operational challenges such as process monitoring, KPI analysis, and defect pattern identification. I am particularly interested in roles where analytical insights can directly support engineering decisions and operational improvements.
